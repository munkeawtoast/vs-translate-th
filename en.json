There are several food preservation methods, combining them can have a multiplicative effect.<br><br><strong>Cellars</strong><br>Any fully enclosed space is considered a cellar and will have a low and consistent year-round temperature. The most simple cellar consists of a 1x2x1 hole with a container in it, that's covered up with soil. More elaborate versions can be up to 7x7x7 blocks in size with a door. To verify a cellar is working, look at any container's block info. You will want to reach the lowest possible food perish speed.

Be sure to place some flowers around. You can move a populated skep inside a free backpack slot by right clicking it. Carry it to the desired location and use CTRL+Scroll wheel to select that backpack slot, to place the skep back down again. Your bees will visit nearby flowers and slowly produce honey, a richly populated skep can also in turn swarm to start a new bee colony in a nearby empty skep. When your skep colony is mature, break it to remove the <a href=\"handbook://item-honeycomb\">honeycomb</a>, note that this is quite likely to anger the bees. Angry bees can become diverted if there happens to be anything nearby which <a href=\"handbook://item-strawdummy\">looks similar</a>.

Placing a block beside the quern will prevent the quern from dropping items on the blocked side, but reduces the grinding efficiency.

Keep both the material and the plumb and square in your hotbar, then right click on a block with the plumb and square in your hands to reinforce. Left click again to remove the reinforcement.\n\nMainly intended as a low level of protection in  multiplayer games, though in single player games you could use it to prevent accidental breakage by yourself.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the reinforcement system see <a href=\"https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php?title=Block_reinforcement\">this wiki page</a>",

    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece1": "Never go into the caves. Never go under the ground. Haven't you heard the story of Blind Bat Rickhart? He was a young boy, just like you lot. Curious, rambunctious, and ready for adventure. Some say he was born in one of the villages around here.\r\n\r\nWell there wasn't much to do in the fields for a boy like that. He couldn't be bothered with tilling the soil or gathering wheat. One year, as it came to be harvest season, he decided to slip away while everyone else was working. He knew his father would be furious, but Rickhart was a greedy boy and he wanted his adventure.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day of traipsing through the heath and forest, young Rickhart had had a great deal of fun, and now the wrath of his father was clear in his mind. He was terrified of going home, so he decided he would stay out for the night and give his father time to calm down and worry about him.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't very bright, but he wasn't very stupid either. He at least knew better than to be caught roaming about at night. By the time the sun was almost gone, he had stumbled upon a deep, well-hidden cave and decided he would pass the night there. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece2": "Well, the sun went down, and he had himself a nice fire built just near the mouth of the cave. He was safe and hidden there, but the rocky floor was uncomfortable and Rickhart was bored of sitting around. So he decided to play a little game with himself. He would walk into the cave's darkness and see which gave out first: his courage or the cave.\r\n\r\nSo he started walking deeper into the cave, brushing off all the warnings his parents and elders had given him since he was born. They had always told him that there were dark things under the earth. Darker even than the monsters we see at night. Rickhart was scared, for sure, but that was all the more thrilling for him. He felt himself just getting into the real adventure as he took one step and then another, deeper and deeper. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece3": "His heart beat like a drum on festival night, but he kept going. He was giggling now, thinking how much fun he was having. He was sure it was all just a silly jaunt, but the images of torn flesh, long hairy limbs, and scraping metal started to fill his head. He could hear his grandmother's ragged voice as he remembered all the old stories she'd told him about the Drifters and horrible Groundlings.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of giving up and running, he bumped headfirst into the cave wall. He'd made it to the end. He breathed a sigh of relief, did a small jig to celebrate his victory, and turned to walk back to his warm fire— only, when he took his first step back the ground gave out beneath him. He fell and fell through the earth, scraping and tearing his skin all the way down. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece4": "When he finally came to stop and got a chance to right himself, he was far below the little cave where he had started. Now young, foolish Rickhart had only one thing in mind: he wanted to get home as quickly as he could. That being said, he couldn't see anything in the immense darkness, and he was so disoriented from the fall that he wasn't quite sure which way he'd came from. All he could tell was that he had landed in a large cavern, and that he could only figure out by the echoing sounds of the rocks sliding after him. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece5": "So he started feeling his way around, looking for something, anything to give him some direction. His hands found a rock face, but something was strange about it. The rock was smooth to the touch. He followed it for a couple feet and realized it formed an entire wall of smooth, even rock. There was some kind of wall here, carved into the earth.\r\n\r\nHaving no other option, Rickhart held his hand to the wall and used it as a guide, walking alongside it, but it led him deeper into the cavern. He followed it for a while, until it suddenly fell away and Rickhart lost his balance, stumbling to the ground. He stood up, and decided to not risk venturing further. He held onto the wall again and tried to walk back to the place where he thought he'd fallen through the dirt.\r\n\r\nOnly, after walking a good distance, he found himself somehow further into the cavern, judging by the sound of his footsteps. In his confusion, he reached out into the open darkness beyond the wall... And felt his hands touching another strange, carved stone wall. He realized suddenly that this was some kind of maze, full of walls in the same shape and design; he must have latched onto the wrong wall after falling onto the ground. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece6": "He was lost. Trapped under the earth in a dark labyrinth with only his grandmother's horrible stories to keep him company. He suddenly remembered all the warnings he'd been given. Never go underground. There are dark things there. Terrors that you can't understand. Rickhart's skin jumped. He felt eyes on him. These unknown 'things' watching him. Waiting for him. He hears movement. A skittering echoes through the cavern. It's getting closer.\r\n\r\nPanicking, Rickhart turned and ran through the maze, stumbling from wall to wall, moving as fast as he could to get away from the skittering. He could still hear it getting closer. He could hear it breathing now, quiet and shrill. He could feel it just behind him. Something large and bristling with hair. He was terrified. He was sure this was the end. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece7": "Just then he crashed into something different. It was large, cold, metallic, and did not give when he hit it. Rickhart was pushed back onto the ground from the impact. The skittering stopped. In its place, this large metal thing started to move.\r\n\r\nHe heard clicking, cranking, stomping, steaming, and other unrecognizable sounds. The thing seemed to be turning about to face him. He was frozen, trying desperately to disappear and somehow wake up in the warm wheat fields and smell his mother's cooking, but instead all he could smell was something like eggs left cracked and burning in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe thing stopped moving. Stopped making noises. Just stood there, like a statue. Gathering his wits about him for a moment, Rickhart realized perhaps it hadn't actually noticed him. Just as he was about to crawl away, the thing suddenly shined one huge light in his face. Rickhart screamed.___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-blindbatrickhart-piece8": "Two days later, the villagers found him after combing through the forest. He was shaking. Blind in both eyes. Covered in dirt. His hands were torn to shreds. Said he dug his way out. He just chose a direction and started digging. Came out through a nearby hill. Got lucky, I suppose. They took him home and did what they could to take care of him, but he was never the same after that. His vision never came back. He would still have shaking fits from time to time. It took his family years to finally get him to tell them what happened. They told the rest of the village about it, and the story spread from there.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would tell the story to curious travelers and young children. There was one thing he always said. One thing he always finished his story with. 'Do you remember the giant metal thing I mentioned?' he would say, leaning in close. He'd whisper, 'The thing that shined a light on me? Well, the truth is, it wasn't a light at all. No, not at all. It was an eye, you know. It saw me. Stared into me. I can feel it staring at me all the time. Except when I tell this story. Then it looks away from me. And where do you think it looks instead? I'm sure you'll figure it out.'",

    "lore-breakdown-piece1": "Constant clamoring. People shouting. I'm worried. Things were quieter before. We had almost given up. Nobody spoke, we just desperately worked on the project. But now it's almost time to wake it and the people are excited. They're too excited.\r\n\r\nThey don't know. They don't understand. I don't even understand it.\r\nWhat have we created? What greater doom have we wrought upon ourselves?\r\n\r\nWe should have all died. Maybe we should have all just died when the Rot came for us.\r\n\r\nI've begun to see things, even when I'm not gazing through the Lens. Walking down the halls, looking at the prints, suddenly my vision shifts and I'm in a world I cannot comprehend. I am in the other world, and it is leaking into this one.\r\nI've begun to notice its effect. My creations: cherished by the people and without which this project could never succeed. They are strange to me now. There is something wrong with them. It is the otherworldliness I have given to them. An eidolon was found two shifts ago with blood and mutilation splattered across its plates. The workmen, they wrote it off as an accident, but I know better.",

    "lore-confession-piece1": "I led these people here, down to these hellish depths. Gave them up to darkness and starvation like lambs to the altar, and for what? This monstrous creation... I fear to recognize it as my child. The common people look upon it as though it were salvation. As though it were god itself. And they see me as the messiah. I walk amongst their halls and shelters, and I shudder at what remains of humanity.\r\n\r\nThey dwell in filth and hunger. Civil services have collapsed under the long, unbearable weight of the endeavor. These men and women have no means of rubbish disposal. Many of them have already been stricken by Rot. If any other soul should wander through their dwellings, they would tear him apart from the ligaments in search of food. And yet, they by some power withstand their hunger when they gaze upon me. They weep for joy and offer me what meager supplies they have.\r\n\r\nOh god, please help me. I am still your faithful servant.",

Even the kings gave him small gestures of welcome. He walked to the center of the court, his attendant behind him bearing a great collection of drafts.\r\n\r\n\"My lords, as I'm sure you're now aware of, we face a nightmarish threat.\"\r\n\r\n\"This disease, or plague as it has been called, is not overly complex. Neither is it beyond our vision. It is, quite simply, desolation made manifest.\"\r\n\r\nHere his attendant began laying out a number of medical diagrams upon the floor. Master Falx issued from one กระดาษหนัง to the next, gesturing as he went.\r\n\r\n\"It rots the body in its entirety. It begins externally with numbness and darkened skin. Proceeding further into the ligaments, the victim may lose control of entire limbs. Eventually, the flesh sloughs off in small heaps. By this time, the victim has likely entered a cataleptic state. This may as well be a blessing for them; the rot will have overtaken their eyes and ears now, depriving them of their senses.\"\r\n\r\nArriving at the last กระดาษหนัง, he paused and gazed upon it. Many of the gathered assembly also leaned forward to see the image more clearly. From the scribe's desk it appeared only to be a drooping mass of charcoal smearings.\r\n\r\n\"This is all that remains of the poor souls. In its final stages, the rot consumes the mind and body whole, leaving nothing left of distinction.\"\r\n\r\nHere His Majesty, the King of Undland interjected, \"Is there truly no method of treating this malady? What preventions are available to Us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No preventions, Your Grace, save total isolation from the populace. Even such a drastic method as that will only last until the food supply is infected. As for treatments, I have found none. Perhaps some of my betters from the academy have made progress, but judging by their silence I think not.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused again here and cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\"It is a certain death. However, I stand here now to offer you a better fate.\"",

No trace of a breeze, no faint stirring of an insect. The Rot itself was dead, and thick static was all that remained. Extinction in its purest form was glaring into my deepest senses.

The old Lord Falx mostly ignored our village in the shadow of his fiefdom, but he was harsh, stringent man who would not suffer the insult of a robbery. Nevertheless, I intended to rob him. \r\n\r\nIt was here in the shade of night that I came upon him: The lord's son, Jonas, stumbling in the dark towards the library. In truth, I presumed myself dead when he discovered me. No harm came to me, however. \r\n\r\nThe boy was also seeking to avoid his father's cruelty, and in me he saw an ally. I knew the forests and paths around this land, as well as the quiet places. In time, I would show them to him. My trespassing onto the estate became a common occurrence. I would teach him about the land and the yeoman's life, and in return he offered me lessons in writing, art, and the natural philosophies.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement continued in secrecy until the day the old Falx died and I was able to walk through the front door as an honored guest. In the same manner, Jonas was welcomed and honored when he came to my village. \r\n\r\nWe were fast friends. Brothers. We were prepared for the coming storm. ___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-reflection-piece3": "Together, we rode for the university. Jonas, up to this point, had been the subject of much talk throughout high society. Those who had met him regarded him as something of a prodigy. A scientific genius. Coupled with his newly inherited lordship, he was expected to do great things. He enrolled at Caydehill to fulfill that potential. Seeking to make my own impact on this country, I accompanied him as a valet.\r\n\r\nJonas made great progress here. In a scant few years he was held in high prestige amongst the peerage and consulted for many natural and philosophical concerns. He found in himself a great propensity for invention, producing many valuable tools to ease the toils of the common folk. For this, I was very grateful. \r\n\r\nFor my own part, I had failed in irritable fashion to ignite any kind of social upheaval. The nobles of the university would pay me no mind, short of glares and outright threats. The workmen, drivers, and cooks treated my words as a fearful poison. Only Jonas would ever listen to my hopes for a peaceful, equitable world free of the chains of serfdom. At times, I suspected he simply humored me, but now I know better. ___NEWPAGE___",

His inventions grew equally more wondrous and monstrous. The eidolons, the locusts, the things without which our endeavor would fail: these he created and shared freely with the world. The people, both common and titled, began to see him as a shining light here to guide them to a new era. In truth, perhaps that would have come to pass were it not for the great adversity we were soon confronted with.\r\n\r\nSoon, the country would begin to understand its own fragility. Each day there were new reports. Refugees wandering from town to town. It felt as though we had all been sentenced to death. That helplessness returns to me still, when I close my eyes. When the emperor sent out the call for assembly, Jonas was among those compelled to find a solution.\r\n\r\nI was there when he was told the news. I remember finding it strange when for a moment his face ran pale and he seemed to shake with fright. But there was nothing strange about that, I see now. He locked himself in his laboratory and bade me not to disturb him. For months he continued this way, leaving only to eat and drink.

If you hear my voice, come find me! Come look for me in the plains, in the forests, by the rivers! Find me, and you too will be mighty!'\r\n\r\nAnd her voice was heard. Other men and women appeared.

Curious that our Church, so eager to lambast every drunkard and enjoyer of the carnal pleasures, remains largely mum on these. Truly.\n\nWhere was I...\n\nMy cousin the King swears by this contraption, and it cost me a pretty penny, but soon, I hear it said, no noble house shall be without one. I wonder what other such inventive tools there are, and what their use might be.\nOn the way back to my estate, I heard word of a traveling alchemist from the Orient, and decided to invite him here with his cart of curiosities. Provided he shows, I might host him for a while, though frankly, he’d do well to entertain me. We shall see how he fares.\n\nAh, my throat is dry. I suppose that's enough for now. How do you make this thing inert?\n\n[Shuffling, followed by scratching, followed by clanking until a sudden thud, then silence]___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-patronage-piece2": "Yes. So. I shall now speak. Ahem.\n\nI am becoming accustomed to the appearance of this device, though it has been some days since I have used it last. Some malfunction - the crooked merchant’s oversight, I am sure - had it just standing there, waiting for the man to arrive and repair it. It better work fine now, or my cousin, the King, will learn of this.\n\nI have mentioned before an inventor. A man by the name of Dastan, where from he hails and why he uses only his first name he does not say. A quiet, small man, unassuming and humble.\n\n[Audible groan]\n\nGod Almighty, such a bore.\n\nIn my sudden fascination with these mechanical toys, I have assumed that inventors are universally bright and intriguing, but no. This Dastan fellow has brought with him trinkets and baubles aplenty, but nothing to truly inspire.\nA ball that gyrates in the อากาศ when spun - a parlor trick, appropriate amusement for a child perhaps, but nothing more. A short reed, through which wine can be poured and which supposedly makes it more palatable - although I tasted no difference. A spice grinder in the shape of some exotic hulking beast… the rest are too uninspiring to even remark upon.\n\nI shall give him a day or two more perhaps to present something from that rickety cart of his to truly put a spark in my eye, or else my hospitality will come to an end. I have no patience for charlatans!___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-patronage-piece3": "[The nobleman’s voice is excited, the change in tone obvious in comparison to the previous entries]\n\nI had started this day resolved to run the inventor out, but he has finally pulled through! I heard him working on something in the stables overnight, the man looked like he hadn't slept at all when I approached. It was the most peculiar thing: wings crafted out of thick fabric and spread over scaffolding, the likes of which I have never seen - to think he kept them under covers for all that time. “They are not ready, and need to undergo trials.” he said. “Come now,” says I, “the sky is clear and you surely have faith in your craft?”\n\nCruel, perhaps, but the gambit was well worth it.\n\nDastan took the contraption to a nearby hill and rode down it like he would a cart. It seemed he would crash on the bottom, but something miraculous started happening in front of our eyes: the invention started lifting, and then sprung into the อากาศ!\n\nAt first I thought it a mere illusion, a trick, but no! He circled the hill and came to a stop at its feet, shaking and pallid as a man not long for this world, but intact! I have fed him, let him rest, and summoned him to my study, where he has just now left. Tomorrow I shall try out this contraption. Dastan was trying to object, but he relented after I offered my pข้าว. Truly, wealth can open many doors and I am fortunate to possess enough to afford such a bargain.\n\nTomorrow, God willing, the name Amaro shall go down in history as the first man to have taken flight!

Your name shall be as wide-spread as that of Falx, and with good reason!\n\nDastan: I am humbled, my lord.\n\nAmaro: Enough coyness! Those who listen to this recording shall know the names of both Dastan the inventor and Tibalt Amaro his patron!

What is its meaning?\n\n[Silence for a few short moments]\n\nAmaro: Fitting. Truly. Very well then.

It is unclear how many were made or how many survived intact into our dark era.\n\nOf note, a children’s story heard by one of our brothers offers an interesting detail, as it concerns a flying bear.

    "lore-miller-piece1": "The Pond\n\nWhat could have been if this chaos had not come between us? I can't stop thinking about him, it grieves me, drives me mad. All I can do now is to write down these memories and draw what I remember with charcoal from the dying fire.\n\nI remember the first time I saw him vividly since it was such an unusually beautiful and peaceful day. The harvest of rye had begun but I snuck away early that day from the workers to enjoy the still summer evening out in the forest. Leaves rustled softly as I walked and small twigs crackled under my feet. Bushes and ferns brushed against my legs and arms.\n\nI reached a glade with fallen trees and pools of water. I made myself comfortable, laying on top of a few moss covered rocks. The surface was dry and soft and the cranberries were blooming all over, buzzing with life. Looking up between the treetops I saw the partly cloudy sky. I would do anything to go back to that moment.\n\nFeeling drowsy from the sweet, warm อากาศ I closed my eyes and just listened. I heard crows scrambling around in the trees and small bits of branches splashed down into the water beneath. Bees were humming to and fro close by my face. A fox barked in the distance.\n\nFootsteps, branches snapping and brushing of vegetation. The sound stirred me from the haze. I thought it was a deer. It was very faint, but getting closer. I looked up and saw a tall man slowly walking towards the bigger pond in the glade. He sat himself down on an old log right by the water. He sat very still, as did I, and just looked at the water and the bugs that were dancing there.\n\nHe was fair and had light, long hair with wavy locks. His gaze was cold but at the same time gentle and at ease. By the look of his rugged hands, strong shoulders, and patched linen clothes he was a hardworking man.___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-miller-piece2": "He leaned forward and picked something from the ground. He looked at his find and pulled a string from his pocket. After a brief moment of tinkering he seemed to have made a necklace that he hung around his neck. A gentle smile spread across his face as he held up the adornment piece in his hand, admiring his simple creation.\n\nI was careful to stay still, not making my presence known. I did not want to disrupt the stillness with my awkwardness. And at the same time I could not take my eyes off him.\n\nHe brought out a piece of folded, yellowed กระดาษหนัง out of his belt bag that he proceeded to scribble on, pausing every now and then looking up, his thoughts seemingly far away.\n\nCarefully he put away the กระดาษหนัง and got down on his knees by the clear forest pool and cupped his hands. He took a sip and then splashed his face, making his short beard glitter with water drops.\n\nHe removed the necklace he had made and hung it on a thin, leafed branch, looked out over the pond one last time and then contentedly walked away through the brush.\n\nOf course I was curious and walked over to the place he had been and inspected the necklace he had made. It was made out of a large acorn from one of the nearby oak trees. If I had only had the bravery to get up and greet him that first time I saw him. But who was I, a shy cow farmer's daughter to do that?___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-miller-piece3": "The Carriage\n\nAs the harvest season went by and autumn was reaching its end, I sometimes went back to the ponds in the forest where I had first seen that mysterious man. I had not seen him before in my village nor could I remember seeing him in the neighboring village either. It was like he had appeared out of nowhere and I couldn't stop thinking about him, to the point where it almost hurt.\n\nThe acorn necklace still hung there, untouched. The summergreen color of the seed was gone and it had turned into a shiny bronze. At some point I realized that he probably wouldn’t come back for it, so I took it and put it around my neck. I felt silly but it was pretty, in a childish and playful way.\n\nMy life on the farm got more busy and rough as winter approached. The cows needed to be fed several times a day as well as the morning and evening milking. The water in their troughs froze and firewood in our cottage was running low. When the winds were just about to turn freezing and snow was in the อากาศ I brought with me my little wooden cart, to the nearby spruce forest to gather some firewood logs to take home and cut.\n\nAs I was struggling with the frozen logs a small horse wagon, loaded with sacks and covered from the snow, came rolling on the muddy forest path. The driver had a thick cloak with a hood covering half his face. The gray, heavy mare was trotting energetically but slowed down to a walk at the light tug of the drivers hands on the reins. The snow was starting to come down heavy and my clothes were by now all covered in white.\n\nThe driver stepped off the wagon and put up a hand in the อากาศ as a greeting. I hesitantly waived back. He pulled out a thick blanket and threw it over his horse. He stroked the old, gray mare between the ears and she snorted content. The driver turned to me.\n\n“Do you need cover from the storm, lass?” he said in a concerned manner.\n\n“If you need help, that is.”___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-miller-piece4": "Since I was getting cold from the snow and wind I precariously walked over and stepped into the wagon. It was dark and not much space, but at least it was dry and sheltered from the wind.\n\nBefore the driver entered the wagon he loosened the horse from the harness and let her walk free. The wagon creaked as he got in beside me. He turned around behind him, lightly brushing against me, as he opened a bag of grain. He scoped out a fist of grain and called his horse, “Dapples, come here girl.”\n\nThe cart horse's head stuck into the wagon and she happily ate the grain from the driver's hand.\n\n“I hope you don’t mind her joining us.” He said with a grin while rubbing the horse's muzzle.\n\nThe driver lowered his hood and I found myself staring as I recognized him. His hair was long, light and slightly tangled from being under the thick woolen hood and his eyes were dark green. My heart couldn't believe the luck that I had stumbled upon him again.\n\n“We certainly weren’t expecting this weather today. Dapples and I were just picking up some grain to bring to the mill.”\n\n“Are you... the miller?” I asked since I remember the miller in the neighboring village being much older.\n\n“Not exactly. Or well. I work the mill now that my father passed. I am the miller's son.” He was quiet for a moment and fiddled with the reins. “I guess that makes me the miller now.” He looked at me with a sad smile.\n\n“I’m so sorry about your father.” I mumbled, looking at my hands.\n\nWe sat in silence for a while, shoulder to shoulder, melting snow dripping from our cloaks and our breaths were smoking from the cold. I wanted to ask a thousand questions, but I couldn't bring myself to do it when I saw the hurt look in his eyes. But maybe that was exactly what I should have done.\n\n“Your father must have meant alot.”\n\n“He was a rough man as millers go, but he did have a good heart. I left my life as a brewer to come back to the mill when he got ill. The old man deserved no less.” The miller scoffed. “I do miss the brewing business though. It was a breath of new life from the slow, farming labors. But as long as I get to brew some of my special Miller’s Mead, all is well.”\n\nHe smiled slightly, then he caught sight of the acorn necklace hanging around my neck.___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-miller-piece5": "“That necklace...” He paused.\n\nWhen I realized, my cheeks blushed and I cursed myself that I still had it, although now I am very glad I kept it. I stammered: “I...I found it by…”\n\n“The ponds in the forest.” He said slowly and looked curiously at me.\n\n“I actually saw you there.” I quickly confessed. “And I...” I started fiddling with the knot of the necklace.\n\nHe put up his hand in the อากาศ to stop me before I could take it off.\n\n“Please, keep it.” He laughed heartily and gently pet Dapples, who was standing half asleep. “Now, where to? Let me drive you. The storm doesn’t seem to be letting up.” He backed up his horse and hopped out of the wagon.\n\n“That’s very kind. But I need to bring the firewood home.” I excused myself.\n\n“Dapples might be an old mare, but she doesn't mind a little bit of extra cargo.” The miller winked, and refastened Dapples to the wagon, and proceeded to load the firewood. I felt a bit overwhelmed by this kindness and quickly sprung to my feet to help him, saying thank you again and again.___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-miller-piece6": "We got into the carriage, our clothes completely covered in snow. The miller asked his horse to move forward in a slow trot. Despite the cold, I found the wintery landscape delightful. The snowflakes tickling the skin of my face and the fresh bite in the อากาศ. Come to think of it, it is probably winter on the surface now. If there only was a way to feel the snow again.\n\nI had a piece of กระดาษหนัง in the pocket of my skirt which I used to make a sketch of Dapples trudging through the snow. The miller glanced at the paper and I shyly showed him the drawing. His eyes brightened.\n\n“Beautiful. In a way it’s like... a poem without words, isn’t it? I… I used to write poems.”\n\nHe slowed down Dapples at a sharp turn in the road.\n\n“I saw you writing something, when I saw you there, at the pond.” I remarked, folding the กระดาษหนัง again and then pulling the cloak tighter around me.\n\n“That was the first time I wrote after many years of not writing at all.” He noticed the curious spark in my eyes.” I know what you are thinking. It has been a long time since I wrote something worth reading. I could not bore you with my nonsense.”\n\nHe seemed a bit embarrassed so I left it at that. Perhaps he had never shared these things with anyone before.\n\n“If you say so. Another time then.” We briefly looked at each other, smiling shyly.\n\nWe rode off down the road as the snowstorm seemed to be waning. My skin was cold, but  I felt warm on the inside all the way home. His presence made me feel so comfortable and safe in a way I had not felt before.___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-miller-piece7": "The Mill\n\nIn early spring when it was almost time to sow the rye I was herding my family's three cows through the woods of the neighboring town. I had my cowherd staff, guiding them through the trees, letting them eat off the sparse, sprouting grass that was growing there.\n\nI stood leaning on my staff, looking out over the town below, seeing the townsfolk going about their business. Smoke was rising from the cottages, the sweet smell of fresh bread wafted trough the อากาศ, and the white sails of the mill were cheerfully spinning in the bright sky.\n\nFrom a distance I saw the miller carrying sacks of grain from a wagon into the mill. He was moving vigorously, not stopping to take a break. He greeted some townsfolk on their way into town and then moved the horse and cart out of the way before he disappeared into the mill.\n\nI was awoken from my daydream, hearing the cows from a distance. The three of them were heading out on the fields. With hurried steps I went out after them but alas they were full of spring energy and cheekiness and just kept running ahead of me. Remembering this now, as I sit here in the cold mountain, I realize how much I really loved those animals, even when they were that naughty.\n\nThey were stopped by a ditch between the mill and the field and I finally got to them. I got in between them and tried to turn them but ended up startling them. One by one they scrambled down and through the ditch to the other side, pushing me off balance and shoving me into the mud. I can still remember the taste and the awful feeling of my feet sinking.___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-miller-piece8": "I saw the cheeky heifers running, skipping, and leaping along, headed to the bright green, sunkissed grass on the hill by the mill. Desperately I tried to group them together but at this point they were all way too mischievous. They ended up scattering, one of them stomping in through the door of the mill. I was staring in disbelief. There was a commotion, the sound of crashing wood, and a cloud of flour flying out the door quickly followed by a ghostly looking cow covered in white flour, bellowing and coughing.\n\nOut from the settling flour stumbled the miller with a wooden shovel in hand and dusty sleeves rolled up to the elbows, swearing, “Damned cow, where did you come from? Shoo!”\n\nHe hesitated when he noticed me and looked me up and down. “Please, herd your animals somewhere not near the mill.”\n\n“They got away and...” I started, flustered.\n\nHe chuckled and raised an eyebrow when he recognized me. “So you are having a bad day as well aye... cowherdess?” He laughed and brushed the flour off his chest. “Last time we met in a snowstorm, now you brought cow mayhem and took a mud bath.” He put the small, wooden shovel on his shoulder.\n\n“Your four legged friend here knocked down two sacks of สเปลท์ flour and knocked the lever from the wooden axle. Jammed it completely...”\n\nThe sails of the mill made a pleasant low, muffled sound as we stood looking at each other. I need not to say that I was beyond embarrassed at that point, just hopelessly standing there, messy, cold, and without cows. But his smile comforted me and ensured that he wasn't too mad.\n\n“The mill will be fine. The brakes are on. Let me help you gather your wild animals.” He looked slightly amused as he grabbed a rope from the wall in the mill.___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-miller-piece9": "We managed to gather the cows into the horse pasture nearby. He noticed I was shivering from the cold, wet clothes I was wearing so he brought me inside the sparsely lit mill. It was quite loud inside from the wooden machinery still spinning.\n\n“We had dairy cows when I was little” He mentioned, looking at me, understanding. “They always got into trouble. Can't live with them and can't live without them” He put his thick woolen mantle around my shoulders when I sat down. It was still warm from his body. The hood was too big and messed up my hair. He lightly brushed a lock out of my eyes.\n\nHe grabbed a wooden hammer and started working on the dislocated machinery. I kept stealing glances at him as he worked. “You are staring.” He mumbled looking back at me. “Come and help me instead.”\n\nWe managed to get the mill's machinery in working order again and the Miller declared he needed a drink. He proudly brought out a jug of his home brewed Miller’s Mead that we shared. It was delicious, a rich taste of honey, hops, grain, and spices. Fit for a noble! Sadly, I doubt I will ever get to taste it again.\n\nThe alcohol soon turned our slightly awkward talk into soft hearted banter. I asked him about his poems that he had mentioned on our last encounter and after much persuasion he brought out a couple that he had written.___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-miller-piece10": "A slight bit of nervousness showed in his eyes when he told me that no one else had heard them before and he ran his hand through his hair several times as he started reading out loud.\n\n“I like how they describe little details in life in such a simple but beautiful way.” I said as he took a brief pause. He seemed relieved to hear this and regained his courage to keep reciting.\n\n“You might recognize this one.” He said softly, looking at me and shared his words as he had memorized.\n\nAcorn on a string. Isn't it a delightful thing?\nA great oak tree born from a small seed.\nGrowing slowly but steadily.\nSilently saying, ”This is but all I need.”\nI carry this one acorn with me.\nIt reminds me of what small things hold.\nAnd thus it makes me stronger and bold.\n\nI brought out the acorn that was still hanging around my neck. The miller nodded silently.\n\n“I would like to see you again soon. There are so many odd rumors going on out in the villages.” He said and pulled me into a light, warm hug. “And I really don’t mind taking care of you, cowherdess.”\n\n“I’m sure they are just rumors.” I said blushing. And oh, how wrong I was saying that.\n\nThat sunny spring day was the last time I ever saw the miller. Only a week after we had met in the mill, the gathering and evacuation of villagers and townsfolk started. I so dearly hope that the miller is safe in a shelter like I am, so that we might have a chance of finding each other again when all this is over. If ever. I still have that acorn, hanging close to my heart. It reminds me of what I have lost, but it also it gives me hope. However slight it may be.",
