<strong>Panning</strong><br><i>There's gold in those hills!</i><br><br>Panning allows the player to obtain small quantities of copper and a few other types of nuggets, as well as other items. It is a useful way to obtain copper nuggets in the early game, if you're not finding enough through exploring.<br><br>All the player needs for panning are a <a href="handbook://block-pan-wooden">wooden pan</a>, water to stand in, and either <a href="handbook://block-sand-granite">sand</a>, <a href="handbook://block-gravel-granite">gravel</a>, or <a href="handbook://block-bonysoil">bony soil</a> (muddy gravel will NOT work). Simply stand in the water, right click the pan on the material to be sifted, and then right click once to start sifting. Each block of material has eight 'charges' for the pan.<br><br>The stone type of sand and gravel makes no difference in results, aside form the stones that you obtain from it. Sand and gravel produce the same results. Bony soil, however, will produce a much different set of results from sand and gravel.
